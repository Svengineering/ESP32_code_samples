# ESP32 Code Samples

* developed with **Arduino Framework**

* still in development 

* trying out some small coding samples for ESP32
  - first sample: read phrase from serial terminal input and turn it to **morse code signals** (LED and speaker)

* using PlatformIO with VSCode, Arduino IDE should also be usable
